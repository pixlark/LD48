 - PCHs on linux
 - no way to tell if Texture::loadFromFile failed
 - how to store reference to component on struct??
 - no +=, -=, etc operators on Vec3
 - no standard output for Vec3
 - "Noramlize()"
 - grabbing the window doesnt pause delta time which fucks up physics
 - Vec3::zero and standard normals would be useful
 - Vec distance function
